	abstract = {This paper presents a new methodology for navigating virtual environments called “The River Analogy.” This analogy provides a new way of thinking about the user's relationship to the virtual environment; guiding the user's continuous and direct input within both space and time allowing a more narrative presentation. The paper then presents the details of how this analogy was applied to a VR experience that is now part of the permanent collection at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry.},
