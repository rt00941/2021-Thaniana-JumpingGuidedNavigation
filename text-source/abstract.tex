\label{Abstract}
With the advance of Virtual Reality, there is a case to be made for narrative experiences such as tours and storytelling to be made virtual as well. This thesis presents a technique for automated guided jumping navigation in immersive virtual environments. The implementation of this technique includes how jumps will take place, pre-travel feedback and gesture control to pause, resume and make choices when needed. To investigate the benefits of this technique, this thesis presents a user study comparing automated guided jumping with free jumping using visual guidance. The results from conducting this study with 9 participants show that automated guided jumping provides similar path recall scores to free jumping. They also show that although free jumping gives lower discomfort scores, higher user comfort, lower task load scores and better comprehensibility of jumps, automated guided jumping still has good results for all these variables. Overall, the study shows that the technique has benefits and potential for further improvement in future work to create immersive environments that provide a narrative structure and require minimal user control.
