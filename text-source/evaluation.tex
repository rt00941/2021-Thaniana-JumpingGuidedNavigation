\label{Chapter:Evaluation of the User Study}
In the previous chapter we saw the study design and procedure. Based on this we planned to conduct the user study with 10 participants. However, 1 participant had to drop out which left us with 9 participants. The demographics showed us that we had participants between the ages of 22 and 33 with 7 out of 9 participants under the age of 30. 3 out of 9 participants were female. This section will analyse and discuss the data we got from the study.
