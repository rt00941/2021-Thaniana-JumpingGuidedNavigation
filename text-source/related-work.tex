As mentioned in Chapter \ref{chapter:Introduction}, this thesis aims to investigate a technique for guided navigation using the jumping metaphor. To understand where the concept for this technique comes from we will take a look at different navigation metaphors for \acrshort{hmd}s and see what the advantages of jumping navigation are. We will then see what the purpose of guiding in \acrshort{ve}s is and why it can be useful for navigation to be guided. Based on this we will then show the motivation for bringing together jumping and guiding into one navigation technique.
